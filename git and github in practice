git stash - So when you are working on a branch, just remember something and want to switch over to a different branch just for reference, but files you were working on appears when u switch branches. here chances of conflicts that arises are higher. so to preserve the code you are writing, u can stash it away. and then switch the branch 

git stash pop - after stashing and working with other branches. after completing ut work u can switcho ver the original branch and then u can pop the stash away. and then the changes will br reflected without any commits

.gitignore - create it and list directory, or filename or pattern to ignore. so it doesnt track changes or push it
